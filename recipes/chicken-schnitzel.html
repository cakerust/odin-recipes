    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Schnitzel, a thinly pounded, breaded, and fried cutlet, is an egalitarian dish. It can be made with just about any meat, it’s universally adored, and it’s easy to make.</p>
    <p>Schnitzel stems from the German word for “slice” referring to thinly sliced meat coated in breadcrumbs and fried. There are cultures across the world that have similarly prepared dishes — like escalope in France, milanesa in parts of South America, milanese in Italy, and katsu in Japan, among many more.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon German mustard</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups fine dry breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 1/2 pounds), trimmed of excess fat</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided</li>
        <li>Canola oil for frying</li>
        <li>1/2 lemon, cut into wedges, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Set 4 large, shallow bowls or quarter sheet trays side by side in a row. Add flour in the leftmost bowl. Add the eggs and mustard into the second bowl. Whisk with a fork until combined well. Add the breadcrumbs into the third bowl. Leave the last one empty. You’ll place your breaded chicken on it.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken breasts on a cutting board and pat them dry with paper towels. Use a sharp chef’s knife to cut each chicken breast horizontally in half lengthwise—you should have 4 thin chicken cutlets that are about the same size. Stack the cutlets on one side of the cutting board to make room for pounding them. Spread a large piece of plastic wrap (at least 7- x 11-inch big) on the cutting board and place one cutlet on it. Fold the plastic over the cutlet, leaving some space around for the cutlet to spread as you pound it. Use the smooth side of a meat tenderizer or the bottom of a small frying pan to pound the cutlet until it’s 1/8 to 1/4 inch thin. Be firm but gentle so that the chicken does not tear. The goal is to get an evenly thin cutlet. Pound the remaining cutlets, one at a time, using the same plastic wrap and replacing it if it tears.</li>
        <li>Evenly season the cutlets with 1 teaspoon salt. Bread one cutlet at a time. Dredge it on both sides with flour, shaking off any excess. Dip it in the egg mixture, letting any excess drip off. Finally, place the cutlet in the breadcrumbs. Sprinkle some breadcrumbs on top and use your hands to gently press them onto the cutlet. Transfer the breaded cutlet into the last bowl. Repeat with the remaining cutlets.</li>
        <li>Set a large frying pan over medium heat and add enough oil until it’s about 1/2 inch deep. Make sure the oil does not come up more than halfway up the sides of the pan. Heat it to approximately 350°F. Don’t have a deep fry thermometer? Sprinkle a pinch of breadcrumbs into the oil. They’ll bubble up right away when ready. Carefully add the breaded cutlets in a single layer. You may need to cook them in 2 batches. Fry them for 2 to 3 minutes. Use a large metal spoon to carefully scoop up hot oil and pour it over the top of the schnitzels as they fry—this is called basting. When the bottoms are golden brown and crisp, use tongs to flip them and fry the other side for 2 to 3 minutes, until golden brown and cooked through. If you’d like, keep the fried schnitzels warm in a 200°F oven. Place them on a rack set over a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Transfer the chicken schnitzels onto a serving platter, sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and serve immediately with lemon wedges.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Leftovers, a rare but potential occurrence, can be refrigerated for up to 3 days. Some people actually enjoy it cold (I’m one of them)! Cube it for a tossed salad or cut it into strips and dip it in mustard straight from the fridge.</p>
    <p>The best way to warm it up: Preheat your oven to 400°F. Place the chicken on a baking sheet and reheat it for about 15 minutes, flipping it once halfway through.</p>
